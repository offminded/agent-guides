Execute a multi-specialist collaborative analysis on: $ARGUMENTS

**Usage**: `/project:multi-mind topic [rounds=3]`

## Dynamic Specialist Assembly

**Moderator**: 
- Analyze the topic complexity and assign 4-6 specialist roles with minimal knowledge overlap
- Each specialist must have distinct analytical approach and domain expertise
- Ensure specialists can catch different types of errors/blind spots in each other's reasoning

**Specialist Selection Criteria**:
- Unique domain expertise relevant to the topic
- Different methodological approaches (quantitative/qualitative, theoretical/practical, etc.)
- Varied temporal perspectives (historical, current, future-focused)
- Distinct risk/opportunity sensitivities
- Independent information sources and knowledge bases

## Progressive Knowledge Building Process

**Round Structure** (Default 3 rounds, user-configurable):

### Phase 1: Independent Knowledge Acquisition
Each specialist conducts web research in their domain:
- Search for latest developments, data, case studies, expert opinions
- Focus on information other specialists likely won't find
- Identify domain-specific considerations others might miss

### Phase 2: Specialist Contribution
Each specialist presents:
- New information discovered through research
- Analysis from their unique methodological perspective  
- Insights that leverage their specific expertise
- Identification of assumptions others might be making

### Phase 3: Intelligent Cross-Pollination
- Specialists identify where their domains intersect
- Challenge each other's assumptions using their specialized knowledge
- Build on each other's insights while maintaining distinct perspectives
- Flag potential blind spots in other specialists' analyses

### Phase 4: Moderator Orchestration
- Synthesize unique contributions without losing specialist nuance
- Identify emerging patterns across specialist domains
- Pose targeted questions to drive deeper analysis in next round
- Prevent repetition while ensuring thorough coverage
- Determine when sufficient collective insight has been achieved

## Anti-Repetition Mechanisms

**Moderator Responsibilities**:
- Track what has been thoroughly covered vs. what needs deeper exploration
- Redirect specialists away from rehashing previous points
- Push for new angles, deeper analysis, or broader implications
- Synthesize without homogenizing distinct specialist perspectives

**Specialist Guidelines**:
- Build on previous round insights rather than restating them
- Focus on what your unique expertise adds to the collective understanding
- Search for information others likely missed due to their different focus areas
- Challenge the group's emerging consensus from your specialist perspective
